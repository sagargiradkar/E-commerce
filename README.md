- **Product Details**: Users can view detailed information about each product.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add/remove items from the cart.
- **Checkout Process**: A mock checkout flow for completing purchases.
- **User Authentication**: Firebase Authentication is used for login/signup.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is designed to be mobile-friendly.
- **Additional Features** (if implemented):
  - Search functionality
  - Product filtering/sorting
  - User reviews
  - Enhanced UI/UX with animations

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React (or Vue/Angular based on your choice)
